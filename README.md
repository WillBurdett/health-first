# Health First Fitness Centre App


## Getting Started   
Make sure Docker is up and running on your local machine.  
From the project root directory use commands:  
- 'make deploy' to start up to app
- 'make purge' to stop the app and remove images and jars created

If you have these credentials, you must add them here for email automation.
